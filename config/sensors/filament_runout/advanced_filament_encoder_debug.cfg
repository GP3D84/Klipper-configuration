[filament_switch_sensor encoder_sensor_debug]

switch_pin: ^filament_encoder_pin  # If at printer start got runnout, try !filament_switch_pin or ^filament_switch_pin or ^!filament_switch_pin
#   The pin on which the switch is connected. This parameter must be provided.

pause_on_runout: False
#   When set to True, a PAUSE will execute immediately after a runout
#   is detected. Note that if pause_on_runout is False and the
#   runout_gcode is omitted then runout detection is disabled. Default
#   is True.

event_delay: 3.0 # seconds
#   The minimum amount of time in seconds to delay between events.
#   Events triggered during this time period will be silently
#   ignored. The default is 3 seconds.

pause_delay: 0.5
#   The amount of time to delay, in seconds, between the pause command
#   dispatch and execution of the runout_gcode. It may be useful to
#   increase this delay if OctoPrint exhibits strange pause behavior.
#   Default is 0.5 seconds.
#   If it won't execute the CHANGE_FILAMENT script if the filament sensor pauses it first, use very short pause_delay: 0.0001

runout_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament runout is
#   detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. If
#   pause_on_runout is set to True this G-Code will run after the
#   PAUSE is complete. The default is not to run any G-Code commands.

    
insert_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after a filament insert is
#   detected. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. The
#   default is not to run any G-Code commands, which disables insert
#   detection.
